Lewis Denham-Parry orchestrates containers by day and hacks them at night.
 
He has consulted in many roles, from developing software on bare metal to building the infrastructure somewhere in the cloud.
 
At Chainguard, he is a Security Engineer helping customers secure their supply chain, from empowering developers to build their containers to offering observability to CISOs.
 
Community is key to Lewis and he has presented talks and workshops at numerous international conferences from KubeCon, SANS, BSides, to local meetups in Wales.
 
When not pretending to be an adult, he spends his time with family, playing sports, reading books, and eating copious amounts of food.
