I work as Developer Advocate for Civo's K3s-powered managed Kubernetes service. Aside from my technical advocacy work (writing guides, editing content from our community, speaking) I also work as a developer for Civo, where I have been responsible for implementing, among others:

- KubeQuest: A gamified educational program to take users new to Kubernetes through deploying their first applications
- An automated refer-a-friend program for the #KUBE100 beta
- CRM integrations with Intercom and other APIs
- Company-internal statistics and reporting
