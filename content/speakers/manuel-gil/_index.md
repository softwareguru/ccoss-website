A dev & content creator with extensive experience in Angular, Nestjs, Java and PHP. As an empirical, creative, and curious person, I enjoy exploring several options for a specific project. My passion for software development and Open Source stems from its great impact on our daily lives. I find satisfaction in analyzing everyday problems and using technology to find solutions. I stay up-to-date with new technologies and methodologies to improve my skills and knowledge.
