I am an Electronic Engineer, current Support Area Leader at Electronic Cats and content creator for the Spanish-speaking community, developing projects and workshops between different areas of study to bring students and enthusiasts closer to technology, electronics, and the open source community. My hobby is learning languages and their cultures.
