I started my career as an engineer in the oil and gas industry where I worked on physical data models, forecasting, and simulation. Like many others, after a few years of working in a data-heavy role in a different space, I decided to fully transition to a career in data science four years ago. I am passionate about applying data science and machine learning to transform existing industries and solve real-world problems. I worked for several years at the intersection of energy and tech - advancing the clean energy transition. Currently, I work with a team building a deep learning based revenue management system for airlines. I am a strong believer in decreasing information disparity through both teaching and learning and am excited to exchange knowledge with other members of the Beam community!
