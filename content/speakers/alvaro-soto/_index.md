I was born in a little town in Chile called Linares. I moved to Mexico at 19 years old to continue my Computer Science Engineering degree (after getting expelled from a university in Chile) and a master's degree in computer science nearly ten years later.
 
 I've worked as a freelancer, implementation engineer, and support engineer for larger and small companies in LATAM: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico.
