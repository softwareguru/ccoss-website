Have you ever wondered how AI products are developed? One of the key parts of the process is called Training. There are multiple ways to do this and, in consequence, several ways to fail and a lot of complexity.
 
 
 
 In this session we'll design and deploy a K8s-native environment we'll use to train an ML model, live and from scratch.
 
 
 
 You'll learn some of the principles that guide the modern and scalable development of AI models.
