Have you faced limited access to observability data for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or dealt with provisioning resources that result in unnecessary costs? Organizations often create autoscaling rules based on CPU and memory usage, but guaranteeing reliability and cost efficiency solely with CPU can be challenging in a Kubernetes environment. How can we effectively leverage observability data in autoscaling rules?
 
 
 
 Discover Keptn's Metric Server, addressing these challenges by consolidating observability data in Kubernetes. Through a real example showcasing inefficient HPA rules, this session explains how Keptn can enhance and optimize the autoscaling process utilizing metrics from Istio/Envoy, but also the cost of your workload.
