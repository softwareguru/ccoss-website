Kubernetes is a powerful tool for deploying and managing containerized applications. However, it can also be a complex and challenging platform to secure.
 
 In this presentation, we'll discuss some of the security challenges. It will start with an overview of the Kubernetes security landscape, including the threats that Kubernetes applications face. Then, I will discuss specific security controls that can be implemented.
 
 We'll highlight real-world examples of Kubernetes security breaches and how they were mitigated. Finally, I will provide information on tools and resources that can be used to secure Kubernetes, such as security frameworks and monitoring tools.
 
 By the end of this presentation, you will better understand the security challenges of Kubernetes and how to overcome them.
