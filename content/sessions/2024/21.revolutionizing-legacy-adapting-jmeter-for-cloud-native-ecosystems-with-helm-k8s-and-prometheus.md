In this session, we will explore the transformative journey of adapting JMeter, a traditional load testing tool, to the dynamic demands of cloud-native environments. With a history predating the cloud-native era, JMeter has been the go-to tool in load testing for many years, however, its conventional application often falls short in the scalable and ephemeral nature of modern cloud-native ecosystems.
 
 
 
 During the session, I want to present some patterns and Helm Chart suggestions to run JMeter within a Kubernetes environment using Deployments, Statefulsets and jobs to manage the Test Simulation lifecycle, while using sidecar containers to push metrics to Prometheus pushgateway.
 
 
 
 I bootstrap everything in a web app written in Go to trigger new Simulations with multiple parameters.
