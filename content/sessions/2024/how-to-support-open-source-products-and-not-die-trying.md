In this talk, I will talk about my experience in the last two years as a young leader in the technical support area where we provide customer support for open source products from Electronic Cats. The problems and challenges that my area has faced, and the contributions made by the open source community. As well as the future of the technical support agent with the arrival of AI tools.
